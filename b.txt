Haar Cascades are a series of machine learning object detection 
algorithms proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones1. 
They are known for being fast and efficient, 
especially in real-time scenarios. 
Haar Cascades work by applying a series of features to 
a sliding window across an image and using a cascade 
function to quickly discard non-faces, which makes them very fast. 
However, they can produce a lot of false positives and are 
not as accurate in detecting faces as some more modern methods1.

On the other hand, MediaPipe offers a collection of 
state-of-the-art machine learning models for various tasks 
including face detection, hand tracking, and pose estimation. 
MediaPipe models are designed to be lightweight and efficient, 
suitable for mobile and edge devices. They provide high accuracy 
and real-time performance on a variety of platforms2.
